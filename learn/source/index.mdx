Welcome.
The easiest way to get started with the Troubleshoot project is to go through a few short tutorials.
Once you've completed these tutorials, you'll be set to add custom Preflight Checks to your application and build your own Support Bundle for disconnected troubleshooting.


<h4>Preflight Checks</h4>
Start here to learn how to add custom preflight checks to your application.
<br />
<Button
  size="large"
  color={colors.primary}
  as={<Link to="/preflight/introduction" />}
>
  Start the tutorial!
</Button>

<br /><br />

<h4>Support Bundle</h4>
When you have an application to support, start here to learn how to define a custom support bundle.
We'll walk through collecting data from the application and analyzing it for known errors and problems.

<Button

  color={colors.primary}
  as={<Link to="/support-bundle/introduction" />}
